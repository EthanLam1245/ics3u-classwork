Functional Decomposition
------------------------

Vending machine from a human perspective (Example from class)
-------------------------------------------------------------

You get a bag of chips from a vending machine
- Approach machine
    - Walk until you are within arms reach
- Determine the number for the flavour I want
    - Search for the specific flavour
    - Look just below it for the ID number (Remember that number)
- Put in appropriate amount of money
    - Look beside the ID number for the cost of the snack
    - Get out some money greater or equal to that amount
    - Place that money into the intake
- Key-in the number for the flavour
- Get bag from bottom of machine
    - Bend down
    - Put arm through slot
    - Grab chips
    - Pull your arm out (with the chips)

Vending machine from the machine's perspective 
----------------------------------------------

You are waiting for someone to give you money so you can give them a snack
- Awaiting input from a user
    - Display a message such as 'awaiting input' on the display panel
- Determine which snack was chosen by the user
    - Read the ID number punched into the machine
    - Compare this ID number with all the available ID numbers (ID numbers indicating the snack)
    - If the ID number matches with a specified snack, store it in memory
- Determine if they paid enough money for that chosen snack
    - Read how much the specified snack costs
    - Read how much the user paid in the intake
    - Compare the money paid to the cost of the selected snack
    - If they did not pay enough, display 'Too few coins', if they paid enough, move on to the next step
- Dispense the snack and return change
    - Release one of the selected snacks into the funnel that leads to the bottom of the machine
    - If the user paid more than needed, return the coins back into the intake
        - Find the difference between the amount needed and the amount paid
- Wait for the next user to get a snack
    - Display 'awaiting input' again on the panel after snack has been dispensed and money has been received
    
There are basic programming concepts all throughout the break-down above, including conditional branching, loops, and nested structures
- For example, comparing the ID number input with all the available ID numbers requires a loop to do it linearly without missing any options
- An if statement is nested within the loop to compare whether or not the ID number matches the specified snack
- If statements are also used to compare the amount of money paid versus the actual cost of the selected snack and basic commands are run depending on the result of the if statements
- Displaying an 'awaiting input' message is also a simple, basic command

Waking up and going to school
-----------------------------

Getting ready and being prepared to go to school and learn
- Wake up at 8AM
    - Use an alarm which is set on loop weekly from Monday to Friday
    - Turn off the alarm once wide awake
- Make my bed
    - Grab the blankets and fold them neatly 
    - Place the folded blankets on the bed
    - Rearrange the pillow back to its usual position
- Eat a quick breakfast
    - Go downstairs
    - Pour some cereal into a bowl
    - Pour milk into the bowl full of cereal
    - Grab a spoon
    - Enjoy the meal
- Brush teeth
    - Go upstairs
    - Wet the toothbrush
    - Apply toothpaste on the toothbrush
    - Scrub the toothbrush on my teeth for 2 minutes
    - Rinse mouth after 2 minutes
- Turn on the computer
    - Press the power button on my computer
- Log into class at 8:30AM
    - Open Google.com
    - Sign in to the google meet with my k12 acount before 8:30AM
    - Indicate that I am in class by saying 'good morning' or 'hello'

Basic programming concepts can be found in the break-down above
- Simple commands
    - Almost every instruction, such as 'go downstairs' or 'go upstairs' or 'say good morning or hello' are all simple commands
- Conditional statements
    - If I am wide awake, then turn off the alarm, if not, I should leave it running
    - If I am finished brushing my teeth, then rinse my mouth
- Looping/repetition
    - My alarm is set on a loop every week from Monday to Friday
    - I must repeatedly scrub the toothbrush on my teeth for 2 minutes (to make sure it is clean)

The cookie is too big for the glass
-----------------------------------

You must dip parts of the cookie into the milk contained in the glass
- Break the cookie into smaller chunks so it can fit in the glass
- Dip one section of the cookie at a time into the milk 

There are many ways to prevent this problem for next time
- Get a larger glass and pour the milk in there
- Buy smaller cookies from the store

How can this problem be solved with an app?
- An app that is designed to

The spoon dropped into the gravy
--------------------------------

To fix this problem, you must clean the spoon so it can be used again
- 

There are several ways to prevent this problem
